I.    METRIC   SPACES:   QUESTION
[Moon   and   Stirling,   2000]   Let   X   be   an   arbitrary   set.   Show   that   the   function   defined   by

is   a   metric.
II.    METRIC   SPACES:   QUESTION
[Moon   and   Stirling,   2000]   Let   (X,   d)   be   a   metric   space.   Show   that

is   a   metric   on   X.   What   significant   feature   does   this   metric   possess?
III.    METRIC   SPACES:   QUESTION
[Moon   and   Stirling,   2000]   In   defining   the   metric   of   the   sequence   space   ℓ∞ (0,   ∞)   as
d∞ (x,y) = sup|x(n) -   y(n)|   ,   n
“sup”   is   used   instead   of   “max”   .   To      see   the   necessity   of   this   defin代 写ECE500/600 Vector Spaces: Metric Spaces

Show   that   d∞ (x,y) >   |x(n) - y(n)|   ,   yn   ≥ 1.
IV.    METRIC   SPACES:   QUESTION
[Moon   and   Stirling,   2000]   Let

(a)   Draw   the   set   B.
(b)   Determine   the   boundary   of   B.
(c)   Determine   the   interior   of   B.
V.    METRIC   SPACES:   QUESTION 
[Moon   and   Stirling,   2000]    The      fact      that      a      sequence      is      Cauchy      depends      upon      the      metric   employed.   Let   fn   (t) be   the   sequence   of   functions

in   the   metric   space   (C[a,b],   d∞),   where

Show   that,

Hence,   conclude   that   in   this   metric   space,   fn    is   not   a   Cauchy   sequence.
